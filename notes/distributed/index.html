Blocking - A primitive is blocking if control returns to the invoking process after the processing for the primitive (whether in syn- chronous or asynchronous mode) completes.

FIFO , NON - FIFO and causal ordering. causal ordering - is based on the lamports happen before relation. In causal ordering eg . send (m1) - send (m2) , in this example the recv of m1 happens before the recv of m2 even though the m2 message is sent earlier , it is stored in the buffer.  distrubuted mutual exclution  only one process is allowed to access the critical section concurrent process can access a shared resources , but kinda serialized as one can access at one time message passing  Three approches  Token based - Unique token , if they have the token with them they can access the crtical section. Non - token based - messages Quorum based - Subset  system model  N - sites asynchronous let us assume there are 5 sites , s1 s2 s3 s4 s5 , if s1 is requesting for the critical section , it waits for the reply from the other sites , during the wait period it cannot place another request to enter the critical section.  process  Request to enter the cs executing the cs release the cs   if two sites request for the critical section , it depends on the time stamp (lamports time stamp) the smallest the time stamp the higher the priority (who places the request first)  requirements of the mutual exclusion  safety property - only one process can execute liveness property - absense of deadlock (wait endlessly for msg) \u0026 starvation (indefinite wait) fairness property - if a site s1 is the sole owner of the token and is not giving the token to other process , and greedily keeps it with itself .  Performance metrics  message complexity - no of message require to execute a cs . synchronization delay - time between the (last site exits the critical section - next site enters the critical section.) response time - the time between the request message sent out and then exiting the critical section . system throughput - 1/ sd + E ; sd = sync delay , E - crtical section execution time.  Non token based for mutual exclusion - lamport algorithm  request the critical section , broadcasts the REQUEST (tsi,i) tsi - time stamp of i (the logical clock) , i is the process id , request_queue (tsi, i)  complexity of lamport  the number of REQUEST - N-1 the number of REPLY - N-1 the number of RELEASE - N-1   Total = 3(N-1)  Non token based for mutual exlusion - ricart agarwala complexity of ricart agarwala  the number of REQUEST - N-1 the number of REPLY - N-1   Total = 2(N-1) optimized than lamport algorithm as we use the deffered queue  ",
